    <h3>Welcome to YouTube!</h3>
    <p>This section outlines our relationship with you. It includes a description of the Service, defines our Agreement, and names your service provider. Key updates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service Provider. Your service provider is now <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google LLC.</a></li>

We have added a link to the Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies, and our Advertising on <a href="https://www.google.com/">YouTube</a> Policies, which all form part of the Agreement. These are the policies that underpin our Community Guidelines, and we wanted to make sure to call out this detail to you upfront in our Terms.</li>
      <li>Affiliates. To ensure you understand exactly who we mean when we talk about our group companies, we’ve included a definition of our “Affiliates”, meaning the companies in the Alphabet corporate group.</li>
